# Mars Rover

This project is my implementation of the Mars Rover brief.  It is a console app that allows you to create and move a Mars Rover.

It takes inputs of the size of the Plateau, the position of the Rover and the movements you would like the rover to take and outputs the resulting position of the Rover.
